          <p className="text-[#757575] ">
            This is our story! We hope that the following 5 minute read will
            give you a little insight into our somewhat unconventional journey
            and inspire you to continue learning. Enjoy :) In 2005, two
            Physiotherapy students at the University of Cape Town came up with
            an idea to start up a company that facilitated one on one home
            tutoring. One of these students, Amy, had been tutoring as a way to
            earn income as a student, and had seen an escalation in the requests
            for someone knowledgeable to assist with various school subjects as
            a form of supplementary learning support. In her 4th year, due to
            long practical hours, Amy was unable to accommodate the increasing
            requests, and started to look for suitable candidates to assist with
            some of the requests she had been getting. This started by offering
            these opportunities to her peers or asking if they knew of anyone
            who could help. Dominique’s entrepreneurial mind started ticking.
            This is how BrightSparkz Tutors was born!

          <p className="text-[#757575] ">
            What’s next for BrightSparkz? In 2020, launched our exciting Mind
            The Gap, a course aimed to upskill high school learners, university
            students and recent graduates – anyone on the hunt for their first
            job for that matter. This comprehensive program covers everything
            from how to choose a field and job to suit your personality and
            lifestyle, to where to search and how to apply for jobs, crafting an
            impressive resume and cover letter, how to prepare for and conduct
            yourself in an interview, and how to successfully navigate your
            first few weeks in the workplace with professionalism. Mind The Gap
            set you up for success! In June 2019, Amy and her family moved from
            Johannesburg to Ontario, and in December 2019, BrightSparkz Inc
            (Canada) was born. We started our Canadian adventure with our Little
            Sparkz and Language Boot Camp series but the unexpected happened and
            the world was launched into a pandemic that would change the way
            that students would learn. Once the dust settled and students were
            back in the classroom, there was a new need – catch up! We’d say
            that 2021 was our first “real” year – the year that we were able to
            start bringing the BrightSparkz magic to Canadian families as we
            always knew it. After a rocky couple of years, we were so grateful
            to be in the privileged position to ensure that students got back on
            track, gained confidence and achieved to their full potentials
            again. We were excited and energized every time a match was made,
            and the feedback we started receiving from families was
            overwhelmingly positive. Our tutor tribe started expanding quickly
            and we have been fortunate to partner with incredible organizations
            along the way, giving us the chance to reach even more children (and
            adults) through learning-based Summer Camp Programs and
            collaborations with local businesses. We have a couple of new and
            exciting projects up our sleeves for 2023 including our very first
            book! We can’t wait to see where we go from here – hope you’ll join
            us!
